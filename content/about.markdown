# Terry Ruas 

Currently working as Postdoctoral Researcher at the Data & Knowledge Engineering Group (DKE) with Prof. Bela Gipp – Bergische Universität Wuppertal, Germany.
My research interest is the result of an overlap between natural language processing, data science, and machine learning applied to text mining to extract semantic features.

Topics of interest: natural language processing, scientific paper mining and recommendation, data science, machine learning, semantic modeling, scientometrics and bibliometrics.
