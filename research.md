## **Interests**
My research interest is the result of an overlap between natural language processing, data science, and machine learning applied to text mining to extract semantic features.


- Natural Language Processing
    - Semantic feature extraction
    - Natural Language Understanding
    - Language Modeling
    - Paraphrase Generation/Detection
    - Attention mechanisms
    - Text Summarization
    - Meeting Summarization
    - Word embeddings (Contextual and Static)
    - Fake News detection
- Scientometrics
- Bibliometrics
- Recommender Systems
- Machine Learning
